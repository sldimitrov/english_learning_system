               The idea about this program came up into my mind at the end of 2023. I used my own hands and everything
              I have learned since my programming journey had started to make my dream come true. The mission is to help
              others as they develop their skills of learning. In SoftUni they do exactly that - they teach you how to
              study. My program will help each one of you to rememberer new words and conquer a world full of wonders!
                   How to use it?
                First of all, you want to save all of your new words in the <list_of_words.txt>,every one on a single
              line with dash and its definition - (apple - red fruit) and so on...
                After the first step is done you will re-run the program and you can start writing sentences with (2)
              from the menu options.   In no time you'll have learned many new words and each one of them is going to be
              stored in your imaginary dictionary (3)   Within the forth operation (4) you are not only going to learn. 
              You're going to be challenged! Choose it and go and face your demons or stay the same forever!
                Last but not least, the (5) is the latest function of the program in which you can hear all of your 
              sentences read by the computer with human voice. Yeah, I know it sound strange but today everything 
              is possible!   If information is all you have needed at this point choose (7) to exit the temple.
              I will be waiting for your return, because I hope that your learning will be an endless process!
