# Description #
 Automation project for school learning. This is the innovative way that
 I am learning new words right now - by using them in sentences.
 To make something useful was my goal making this program. I am going to use it this year to prepare myself for the Final English Exam in 12th grade. How to use the script:
1. Input the words or phrases into a txt file every one on a new line.
2. Initialise another empty file (sentences_list.txt) in this example (or you can just change the path as you like) to save the written sentences.
3. Run the program and translate every word(https://translate.google.bg/?hl=bg), then put it in a sentence.
4. Once the program has been terminated the last step is re-reading the output file as many times as needed to memorise the whole sentences and then the meaning of the new words as well.
5. If that project helps you in one way or another don't forger to put a star on my sky ;)

# Knowledge stack #
Python was involved, of course.
- functions, file manipulation, dictionaries, lists, etc.
